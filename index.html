        <h2>IS IT AN OUTDOOR WEDDING?</h2>
        <p>
          The ceremony will take place in one of the Residence Tera gardens. We'll go inside for the dinner and party.

    <section class="qa" id="dresscode">
      <img src="images/dresscode.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>WHAT'S THE DRESS CODE?</h2>
        <p>
          We recommend cocktail attire.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>For women</b>, this usually means a cocktail dress (but if you're feeling a
          floor-length gown - go for it!).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>For men</b>, cocktail attire is a suit that's not as formal as a black-tie suit
          would be - or a pair of dress pants and a nice shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Overall, we want you to feel confident in your clothes
            so there is no strict dress code.</i>

    <section class="qa" id="colors">
      <img src="images/colors.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>WHAT ARE THE WEDDING COLORS?</h2>
        <p>
          We chose gold (#E1C340), teal green (#006D5B), and white.
        </p>
        <p>These colors will be present in many wedding
          elements, such as decorations and accessories, but we don't expect our guests to follow this color scheme when
          choosing their clothes.

        <h2>DO YOU HAVE ANY GIFT RECOMMENDATIONS?</h2>
        <p>
          All kinds of gifts are welcome!
        </p>
        <p>From a practical standpoint, we'd prefer to avoid vouchers. 99% of the time
          when someone gives us a voucher, they expire without us using them.

        <h2>CAN I BRING FLOWERS?</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to bring a bouquet, please feel free to do so! However, we prefer not to receive potted plants.
          Our cat eats them and there is no way for us to keep them.

        <p>
          <b>Subway</b> - you should get off the train at the Mladost 1 station. From there you have to walk around 600 meters
          along Andrei Sakharov Blvd.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Busses</b> 111, 113, 314 or trolley 5. The stop you need is "1400"- Посолствата (The Embassies).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Cab</b> - select the address „Академик Андрей Сахаров“ 56 (Andrei Sakharov 56). You can use the TaxiMe app.

        <h2>WHERE CAN WE PARK?</h2>
        <p>
          There are a few parking spots at the Residence. You can also park in front of the multifamily building across
          from the venue.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you prefer to use the Residence parking (recommended for guests with kids and strollers),
          please let us know.

        <h2>WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?</h2>
        <p>
          We'll be happy to see them at our wedding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll provide:
          <ul>
            <li>kids entertainers;</li>
            <li>a room next to the dining hall for them to play in;</li>

        <p>
          We won't have:
          <ul>
          <li>special high chairs for kids. If you have a small kid that can't sit on an adult chair yet, we recommend
          bringing a stroller or a high chair for your convenience.</li>
          <li>their favorite toys. We recommend bringing their favorite book or toy to make them more comfortable.</li>
        </ul>

      <div>
        <h2>WAIT... DIDN'T YOU GET MARRIED ALREADY?</h2>
        <p>
          We got married on October 10th, 2021 - our third anniversary. Back then we couldn't gather all of our friends
          and family for a celebration. That's why we'll celebrate together on June 5th, 2022!
