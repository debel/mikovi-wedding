        <h2>IS IT AN OUTDOOR WEDDING?</h2>
        <p>
          The ceremony will take place in the gardens. Then we'll go inside for the dinner and party.

      <div>
        <h2>WAIT... DIDN'T YOU GET MARRIED ALREADY?</h2>
        <p>
          We got officially married on October 09th, 2021 - our third anniversary. But since we couldn't invite all of our friends
          and family, we'll be celebrating together on June 5th, 2022!

    <section class="qa" id="dresscode">
      <img src="images/dresscode.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>WHAT'S THE DRESS CODE?</h2>
        <p>
          We recommend cocktail attire.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>For women</b>, this usually means a cocktail dress (but if you're feeling a
          floor-length gown - go for it!).
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>For men</b>, cocktail attire is a suit that's not as formal as a black-tie suit
          would be - or a pair of dress pants and a nice shirt.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Overall, we want you to feel confident in your clothes
            so there is no strict dress code.</i>
        </p>
      </div>

    <section class="qa" id="colors">
      <img src="images/colors.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>WHAT ARE THE WEDDING COLORS?</h2>
        <p>
          We chose gold (#E1C340), teal green (#006D5B), and white.
        </p>
        <p>These colors will be present in many wedding
          elements, such as decorations and accessories, but we don't expect our guests to follow this color scheme when
          choosing their clothes.
        </p>
      </div>

    <section class="qa" id="presents">
      <img src="images/presents.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>DO YOU HAVE ANY GIFT SUGGESTIONS?</h2>
        <p>
          All kinds of gifts are welcome!
        </p>
        <p>From a practical standpoint, we'd prefer to avoid vouchers. 99% of the time
          when someone gives us a voucher, they expire without us using them.
        </p>
        <p>We are also not too keen on presents of religious nature (icons, crosses, etc).
        </p>
      </div>

    <section class="qa" id="flowers">
      <img src="images/flowers.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>SHOULD I BRING FLOWERS?</h2>
        <p>
          If you want to bring a bouquet, please feel free to do so! However, we prefer not to receive potted plants.
          Our cat eats them and there is no way for us to keep them.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="qa" id="kids">
      <img src="images/kids.webp" />
      <div>
        <h2>WHAT ABOUT THE KIDS?</h2>
        <p>
          We'll be happy to see them at our wedding.
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll provide:
          <ul>
            <li>kids entertainers;</li>
            <li>a room next to the dining hall for them to play in;</li>
            <li>kids menu;</li>
            <li>coloring books.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          We won't have:
          <ul>
          <li>special high chairs for kids. If you have a small kid that can't sit on an adult chair yet, we recommend
          bringing a stroller or a high chair for your convenience.</li>
          <li>their favorite toys. We recommend bringing their favorite book or toy to make them more comfortable.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>

    <section class="qa" id="transport">

      <div>
        <h2>HOW CAN I REACH THE LOCATION?</h2>

          along Andrei Sakharov Blvd.

          from the venue.
